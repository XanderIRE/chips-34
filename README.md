# chips-34

Prototype, diodless pcb with minor key stagger and two thumb keys.

This started as a project to learn [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) and [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)

- Work-in-progress pcb that is under **100mm x 100mm** in order to facilitate a common discounted price for pcb manufactures for small pcbs.
